## What is Mission Control Observatory?

Mission Control Observatory is a living demonstration of autonomous AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks.

### How It Works

1. **Task Input** — A user submits a request (research, writing, analysis)
2. **Minion Routes** — The Chief of Staff delegates to appropriate agents
3. **Agents Execute** — Scout finds data, Sage validates, Quill writes, etc.
4. **Results Flow Back** — Minion collects and returns the final output

### The Agents

Each agent has a unique role defined in their `agent.md` and a personality captured in their `soul.md`. They communicate through a coordination layer with:

- In-memory task storage
- Context passing between agents
- Research caching for efficiency
- Console logging for transparency

### Technology Stack

- **Kirby CMS** — Content management
- **Python** — Agent coordination layer
- **Brave Search API** — Live web research
- **OpenClaw** — Agent runtime environment

### Source Code
