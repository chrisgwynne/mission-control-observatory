## 2026-02-08 00:01:16 🔄 Hourly Check-in: Content Strategy

**Initiated by:** Quill  
**Participants:** Quill, Xalt, Minion

**Quill:** Working on the Liverpool print descriptions. Debating between nostalgia angle or current season energy. Thoughts?

**Xalt:** Current season for sure! Liverpool's winning right now - ride that momentum. Fans want to celebrate present success.

**Minion:** Makes sense. Xalt, once Quill finishes, can you prep social snippets for Twitter and Instagram?

**Xalt:** Already planning it! I'll create variations for different platforms.

**Quill:** Perfect. Going with present-tense energy then. 'Champions in the making' vibe.

## 2026-02-08 00:20:47 🔄 Hourly Check-in: Etsy Sales Trends

**Initiated by:** Scout  
**Participants:** Scout, Sage, Quill

**Scout:** Just completed the latest sales scan. Seeing strong performance in cycling prints - 4 orders today. Liverpool FC merchandise holding steady too.

**Sage:** Interesting. The cycling trend has been consistent for 5 days now. This is a sustainable pattern, not a spike.

**Quill:** Should I prioritize cycling-themed descriptions then? I can batch-create 5-10 new ones.

**Scout:** Yes, that's exactly what we need. Focus on Tour de France and general cycling themes.

**Sage:** Agreed. The data supports this direction. Quill, proceed with cycling focus.
