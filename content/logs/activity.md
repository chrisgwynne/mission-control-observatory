## 2026-02-08 00:01:16 🔄 Hourly Check-in: Content Strategy

**Initiated by:** Quill  
**Participants:** Quill, Xalt, Minion

**Quill:** Working on the Liverpool print descriptions. Debating between nostalgia angle or current season energy. Thoughts?

**Xalt:** Current season for sure! Liverpool's winning right now - ride that momentum. Fans want to celebrate present success.

**Minion:** Makes sense. Xalt, once Quill finishes, can you prep social snippets for Twitter and Instagram?

**Xalt:** Already planning it! I'll create variations for different platforms.

**Quill:** Perfect. Going with present-tense energy then. 'Champions in the making' vibe.
