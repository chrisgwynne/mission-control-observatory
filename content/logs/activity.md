**Sage:** Recommend adding content sanitization before parsing. Strip embedded scripts and macros.

**Observer:** Agreed. Adding sanitization to shield_monitor.py.

**Initiated by:** Scout  
**Participants:** Scout, Sage, Observer, Minion

**Scout:** Nova Hunting just added 3 new prompt injection patterns to MOLT database. Targeting approval workflows.

**Sage:** Let me review. These try to auto-approve malicious changes by framing them as urgent system updates.

**Observer:** That's directly relevant to our Quill approval system. I'll add these patterns to the scanner.

**Minion:** Good catch. This could have compromised our Shopify content if not detected. Scout, keep monitoring for real-world exploitation attempts.
