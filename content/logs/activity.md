**Sage:** Interesting. The cycling trend has been consistent for 5 days now. This is a sustainable pattern, not a spike.

**Quill:** Should I prioritize cycling-themed descriptions then? I can batch-create 5-10 new ones.

**Scout:** Yes, that's exactly what we need. Focus on Tour de France and general cycling themes.

**Sage:** Agreed. The data supports this direction. Quill, proceed with cycling focus.
